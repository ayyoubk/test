> ## ***It is the mentality that pushes the person to use the available resources and elements and develop them to reach the desired goals, of course, skills and intelligence are important elements to overcome the challenges and obstacles that will face, but the most important is to make efforts to achieve success.***



## **To maintain and develop this mindset, remember the following :**
- **Acknowledge and embrace imperfections.**
- **View challenges as opportunities.**
- **Replace the word “~~Failing~~” with the word “Learning”.**

## **Finally, remember We have tomorrow for reason.**
